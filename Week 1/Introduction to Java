### Application Program Development: Java for C++ Programmers

**I

#### Week 1 Agenda

The first week covers an introduction to Java for C++ programmers, highlighting similarities and differences between the two languages. We also explore the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and how to design a system using this pattern. The lab session includes the installation of Java, JavaFX, and Scene Builder.

#### Outcomes

By the end of the week, you should understand Java as a language, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and the Java Garbage Collector.

#### Understanding Java

Java is a versatile, general-purpose, object-oriented language that is platform-independent and supports concurrent programming. It allows you to write code once and run it anywhere (WORA), making it suitable for various applications including game development, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

#### Popularity of Java

Java is popular due to its ease of use, extensive learning resources, inbuilt functions, and active community support. It offers high-quality development tools that enhance efficiency. Java code runs on multiple platforms without needing modification, providing strong security features that protect against malicious code.

#### How Java Works

Java works as a bridge between human-readable code and machine language. Understanding Java involves knowing the Java language and APIs, which are pre-written programs that simplify development tasks. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) acts as an interpreter, allowing Java programs to run on any machine with JVM installed. Java uses a combination of compiling and interpreting, where code is first compiled into bytecode and then interpreted by the JVM for execution on the specific hardware platform.

#### Java Editions

Java is available in three main editions: Java Standard Edition (JSE) for desktop applications, Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) for server-side applications, and Java Micro Edition (JME) for mobile applications. This course focuses on JSE.

#### Steps to Use Java SE

To use Java SE, you write your code, compile it into bytecode using the `javac` command, and run it using the JVM with the `java` command. The JVM verifies and executes the bytecode, ensuring the program is well-formed and ready to run.

#### Question Time
